# CPU Scheduling Simulation

This project simulates two CPU scheduling algorithms: 
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)

## How to Run
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
2. Compile and run `Program.cs`.
3. Follow prompts to input process details and select an algorithm.

## Outputs
- Average Waiting Time
- Average Turnaround Time
- CPU Utilization
- Throughput
- Average Response Time
- Gantt Chart (text-based)

Sample outputs are available in `/Output/SampleOutput.txt`.

## Notes
- HRRN is non-preemptive.
- SRTF is preemptive and executes processes per time unit.
